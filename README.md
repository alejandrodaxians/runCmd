## RUNNING SHELL COMMANDS WITH SCRIPTS
<br>
This repo presents a script, written in Python and GoLang respectively, that allows us to run any number of shell commands just running one file. This specific example runs both docker build and docker p√πsh to create and upload an image to the GiHub container registry. 

<br>

The usage is easy, you must pass the three arguments needed for the docker commands to succesfully run: the GitHub account that'll store the package, the project name inside said GitHub account, and the package version.

Say we want to upload the package to a repo named "myproject", inside Elon Musk's account, in its version v1.1.2. Then the command will read as follows:

<br>


### Python:

```python
python runCmd_python.py elonmuskgithub myproject 1.1.2
```

### GoLang:

```golang
go run runCmd_golang.go elonmuskgithub myproject 1.1.2
```

If there's a valid Dockerfile in the folder you are running this program from, the image will be built and pushed.
